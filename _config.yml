author: Jonny Galloway (aka HogJonny)
author_bio: Hi, my name is Jonny Galloway. I am a Sr. Design Technologist at Amazon working on technology, tools and workflows for creative professionals like video game developers and others who need the best in 3D and Realtime Rendering tool-sets. He started in 1993 as a Media Service Intern making 3D clip art for Strata3D (a graphics company). His first 3D point and click adventure game took 3 yrs to make and was released in 1996, and he has been involved in the 3D entertainment and video game technology world ever since (29 yrs.) Over the course of his career he has been a 3D Artist, Game Designer, Creative Director, Art Director and Technical Art Director (coding, yeah!) He's been the project lead and Producer on projects from small indie games to big AAA projects, managing development teams. He's worked in creative design, ideation, planning, under Product Development on large open world games like GTA and the Red Dead franchise. Most recently he has worked at several video game technology companies making better tools and workflows, and provide quality of life for creative professionals working in 3D. His ambition and goal it to make Amazon AWS a visual technology powerhouse (and this starts with culture.) ** Views expressed are my own. All opinions are my own. The opinions expressed here belong solely to myself, and do not reflect the views of my employer / Amazon and AWS, the Open 3D Foundation or it's sponsors. **
