  description: "Starhawk (2012 PS3 exclusive) - Served as Lead Environment Artist, defining the industrial oil-rig-inspired visual language and architectural aesthetic. Developed comprehensive modeling style guides and technical standards for world-building at scale. Architected dynamic construction/destruction systems for real-time dynamic “Build & Battle” content, while contributing hands‑on environment modeling, lighting, and hero landmarks. Architected a procedural terrain toolkit encompassing terrain generation at large scales, texture blending, and automated decorative placement—creating all in-game landscapes. Pioneered a custom pre-PBR material authoring styler, with swappable material sets via package signature/contract referencing system, optimized for strict memory budgets. Implemented advanced shaders including improved gravity-based wind bending for vegetation and canopy systems. This gallery showcases the whole game including vehicle high-poly renders including the iconic Hawk transforming mech, dropships, and ground vehicles."
