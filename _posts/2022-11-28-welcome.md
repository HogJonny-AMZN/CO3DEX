# Welcome to the Co3deX

![2022-11-28-14-44-17-image.png](../assets/img/posts/2022-11-28-welcome-assets/53f96d04f47184e691e02d03a1b826738c74343e.png)

Hello and welcome to the Open 3D Engine CO3DEX, a blog of my Journey's in Real-time 3D Graphics and Technical Art.  The Open 3D Engine ([O3DE.org](https://www.o3de.org/)) is an Apache 2.0-licensed multi-platform 3D engine that enables developers and content creators to build AAA games, cinema-quality 3D worlds, and high-fidelity simulations without any fees or commercial obligations.  [GitHub - o3de/o3de: Open 3D Engine (O3DE)](https://github.com/o3de/o3de)

## What is the Co3deX?

Well first of all, I just thought it would be a clever name.

>     <u>o3de</u> = Open 3D Engine
> 
>     <u>codex</u>
> 
>     *noun*
> 
> 1. an ancient manuscript text in book form.
>    
>    - an official list of medicines, chemicals, etc.

Thus the `c+o3de+x = co3dex` is born.  This co3dex documents ***many talents, spells, magic items, potions and equipment*** that determines to help users and the community  get the best out of using O3DE to create experiences across many verticals ... including *VFX*, *Virtual Production*, *Game Development*, *Digital Twins* and more.

Basically, I have a pretty deep understanding of the engine capabilities, as well as knowledge of more advanced workflows.  These concepts often may not be well covered in the component documentation itself, or my not have tutorials written for them either.  And sometimes, I want to cover the more abstract aspects or concepts themselves (why something is important, or why it was implemented that way, or how it actually works.)  So, I wanted something like a blog so that I could teach people and do some knowledge transfer.

Extending on that, at work I am part of a team of talented Design Technologists, who all have experience in varying degrees of 3d design experience, in video games, vr, vfx, etc.  We build things using the engine, editor and digital content creation (dcc) tool ecosystem, and have experience with technical art, python, ux prototyping and such.  We also take active roles in the in ideating and building of entire workflows and pipelines used by other creatives.  And we also serve as a fundamental bridge between product and engineering.  So I often also think of my team as a codex resource of sorts...

Through that lens, we are the '*<u>C</u>reative <u>O</u>pulence and <u>D</u>esign <u>EX</u>perience*' group, working towards '*Innovative First*' thinking and '*Creative First*' excellence.  We dream, we experiment, and we prototype.  We often dogfood the customer experience of building experiences utilizing Amazon technologies using solutions like 'Open 3D Engine' (O3DE), and we use this experience to influence and improve the product design, feature set, tools and end-to-end workflows (in a systems cross-cutting manner.)

O3DE as a feature set is huge, there are many teams and always many things in flight. A lot of the foundation and core needs of actual shipping games cover *cross-domain* and *cross-functional* workflows and integrations across systems, not just the basic usage for a component.  I want to help users understand how to better build experiences of many varieties *Digital Twins, Automotive Car Configurators, Short Films, Video Games and more...*

So there you go, the first post is live.  More to come.

```python
import logging as _logging
_MODULENAME = 'co3dex'
_LOGGER = _logging.getLogger(_MODULENAME)
_LOGGER.info(f'Initializing: {_MODULENAME} ... Hello World!')
```
