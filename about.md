I'm a **polymath technical art leader** who bridges art, tools, engine, and product.

I'm a Principal Technical Artist and tools/engine specialist with 30+ years in AAA game development, working across content, design, production, and technology. I help teams ship large, beautiful games more reliably by building the tools, pipelines, and systems that keep artists moving and engines happy.

I don't fit a mold, and that's intentional. I'm a **multi‑passionate polymath and autodidact**: educated in digital arts, self‑taught in most of the engineering, tooling, and systems work I do today. My value is in **connecting disciplines** and turning that breadth into practical systems that artists, designers, and engineers actually enjoy using.

## What I Do

Teams bring me in when they're hitting walls with content scale, performance, or toolchain complexity. My focus areas include:

- **Technical Art Leadership** – Bridging art, engineering, and design
- **Engine, Tools & Pipeline Development** – Game engine features, custom tooling, asset pipelines, workflow systems
- **Real-time Rendering** – HLSL shader development, lighting systems, performance
- **Python-based Tooling** – DCC integrations, pipeline automation, artist tools
- **Procedural World-Building** – Terrain systems, environment art workflows
- **Performance & Memory Optimization** – Keeping large worlds running smooth

Whether it's authoring shaders, building Python tools for Maya/Blender/DCC apps, designing procedural content systems, or optimizing rendering pipelines, I work at the intersection where art needs meet technical constraints.

## The Journey

I started in 1993 as a **Media Service Intern at Strata3D**, making 3D clip art for a graphics company. My first 3D point-and-click adventure game took three years to make and was released in 1996. I've been immersed in the 3D entertainment and video game technology world ever since—**over 30 years now**.

My career has unfolded through **four distinct phases**, each building on the last:

### Phase 1: Game Development (Artist → Project Lead)

I started as a **3D Artist**, progressing through **Game Designer** and **Creative Director** roles, eventually running teams and projects. At **Ritual Entertainment**, I led development on **Elite Force 2**—managing the full production cycle from art and design through shipping.

### Phase 2: Producer & Product Development

At **Rockstar Games**, I shifted into a **Producer and Product Development** track, working on the **Grand Theft Auto** and **Red Dead** franchises. This phase taught me how large open-world teams operate, how to scale content pipelines, and how to think strategically about production infrastructure. I wasn't yet "technical art"—I was learning how massive AAA games get made from a production and product lens.

### Phase 3: Technical Art Specialization

Joining **Incognito Entertainment/Lightbox** (Sony Santa Monica), I pivoted into **Technical Art**, working on **Starhawk** and **Warhawk**—large-scale multiplayer titles where performance and workflow efficiency were critical. At **Bluepoint Games**, I deepened this expertise on PlayStation remasters including **Uncharted: The Nathan Drake Collection** and **Gravity Rush Remastered** (PS4/PS5), focusing on visual fidelity, optimization, and cross-platform rendering.

### Phase 4: Engine, Tools & Cross-Functional Leadership

My most recent phase has been in **game engine and tools development**—a natural evolution that draws on all prior experience. At **MaxPlay/OrigamiSky**, I worked on cloud gaming infrastructure (MaxPlay GDS). At **Amazon/AWS** (2016-2023), I led technical art and product initiatives on **Open 3D Engine (O3DE)** and its **Atom renderer**, **AWS Lumberyard**, establishing Python-based tooling ecosystems and procedural world-building systems. Returning to **Bluepoint Games** in 2023 as Principal Technical Artist, I'm now applying that engine-level expertise to next-gen PlayStation development, building robust Python pipelines (PySide6, async/concurrent patterns), custom DCC integrations, procedural tools, and runtime optimizations for PS5. This work is deeply cross-functional: writing shaders, architecting tool APIs, designing workflows, profiling performance, and defining technical vision—all informed by decades of shipping games and understanding what teams actually need.

### The Through-Line

Each phase gave me a different lens: **artist empathy, production discipline, technical depth, and engine-level systems thinking**. Combined, they make me effective at the intersections—between art and engineering, content and performance, vision and execution. I've collaborated with teams at **EA, Activision, Atari, Take-Two/Rockstar, Sony, Amazon Game Studios, and AWS Game Tech**. I'm **Scaled Agile certified** and comfortable operating at both hands-on (writing shaders, scripting tools) and strategic levels (defining workflows for 100+ person teams).

## Recent Work

I currently work at **Bluepoint Games (Sony SIE, PlayStation)** as a Principal Technical Artist, leading technical art and tooling initiatives for next-generation PlayStation development on an unannounced PS5 title.

Prior to that I worked at Amazon Web Services (AWS) as a Senior Design Technologist and Product Manager, focused on making AWS a visual technology powerhouse for game developers, filmmakers, and real-time 3D creators. This includes work on the Open 3D Engine (O3DE), an Apache 2.0-licensed multi-platform 3D engine that enables developers to build AAA games, cinema-quality worlds, and high-fidelity simulations without fees or commercial obligations.

My work spans:

- Runtime performance and PS5 hardware optimization
- Game engine requirements, feature and tool design, UX research
- Modern Python pipelines (PySide6, async/concurrent patterns)
- Custom DCC integrations (Maya, Substance, Photoshop)
- Procedural level-generation tools and world scaffolding
- Artist-centric workflows and professional coding standards
- Deep runtime profiling while maintaining visual quality targets
